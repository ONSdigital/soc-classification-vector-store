"""This module contains test cases for the Vectore Store API using FastAPI's TestClient.

Functions:
    test_read_root():
        Tests the root endpoint ("/") of the API to ensure it returns a 200 OK status
        and the expected JSON response indicating the API is running.

    test_get_config():
        Tests the "/v1/soc-vector-store/config" endpoint to ensure it returns a 200 OK status
        and verifies that the configuration includes the expected LLM model.

Dependencies:
    - pytest: Used for marking and running test cases.
    - fastapi.testclient.TestClient: Used to simulate HTTP requests to the FastAPI app.
    - http.HTTPStatus: Provides standard HTTP status codes for assertions.
